# TechEazy DevOps Internship Project

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the TechEazy Consulting DevOps Internship. It consists of two main assignments:

* **Assignment 1:** Setup an EC2 instance that runs a Spring Boot application and uploads application logs to S3.
* **Assignment 2:** Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions to deploy the application automatically.

---

## Technologies Used

* **AWS EC2:** Hosts the Spring Boot application
* **AWS S3:** Stores application logs
* **AWS IAM:** Manages instance profile and permissions
* **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipeline
* **Bash:** Deployment and log upload scripts
* **Spring Boot:** Java web application framework

Got it! I've removed the stars from the subheadings in the README.md and ensured the formatting remains clean and pretty.

## How to Deploy

1.  **Create and configure EC2 instance**

    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy_ec2.sh dev
    ```

    This script:
    * Imports your SSH key to AWS
    * Launches an EC2 instance
    * Installs Java, clones the app repo, and runs the app

2.  **Access the app**

    Once the EC2 is live, access the app:

    ```
    http://<public-ip>:8080/hello
    ```

3.  **Upload logs to S3**

    Run this from inside the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/upload_logs.sh dev
    ```

    This uploads `app.log` to your S3 bucket.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

* **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
* **Trigger:** Push to `main`

It connects to EC2 via SSH and redeploys the application automatically.

Ensure you set the following GitHub secrets:

* `EC2_HOST`
* `EC2_USER`
* `EC2_KEY` (base64 encoded private key)
